# Project 3 — Architecture & Design Rationale

## Overview
This project refactors the Project 1/2 code into a small object-oriented system demonstrating:
- **Inheritance**: `AbstractTask` → `Assignment`, `Exam`, `Project`
- **Polymorphism**: `get_priority()` and `calculate_time_remaining()` are defined on the base type and implemented/overridden in derived types.
- **Composition**: `Student` has assignments and courses; `Course` has tasks and study groups; `StudyGroup` has members and meetings.

## Inheritance Hierarchy
AbstractTask (ABC)
├─ Assignment (concrete)
│ ├─ Exam (specialization)
│ └─ Project (specialization)


### Why this hierarchy?
- There is a true "is-a" relationship: each derived class *is-a* kind of task.
- Behavior common to all tasks (title, due date, weight) is placed in the abstract base; specialized behavior (exam criticality, project estimated-hours) is in derived classes.

## Polymorphism
- Code can hold references to `AbstractTask` or `Assignment` and call `get_priority()`. The call dispatches to the correct derived implementation at runtime.
- Tests show lists of heterogenous tasks can be processed uniformly.

## Composition vs Inheritance decisions
- `Student` **has-a** list of assignments and courses. It is not a subtype of a course or a task; composition is correct.
- `Course` **has-a** list of tasks and study groups; again, not an "is-a" relationship.
- Composition keeps hierarchies shallow and responsibilities clear.

## Use of super()
- Derived classes call `super().__init__()` to initialize common fields from the base class and avoid duplication.

## Tests
- `tests/*` include unit tests for:
  - Abstract class enforcement
  - Inheritance correctness
  - Polymorphic behavior
  - Composition relationships
  - Integration example demonstrating typical workflow

## How this meets project requirements
- **Inheritance Hierarchy**: implemented via `AbstractTask` + 3 derived classes.
- **Abstract Base Classes**: `AbstractTask` uses `abc`.
- **Polymorphism**: demonstrated in tests and integration example.
- **Composition**: `Student` & `Course` relationships implemented and tested.
